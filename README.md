### Count the Elements

Using the attached HTML file, write a function called countHello that will count how many `<li>` tags have the text "Hello" as their innerHtml on a page and return that number.

You can add it to the end of the attach hello.html file in a script tag.

E.g. Given the html:
```
<ul>
  <li>Hello</li>
  <li>Hello</li>
</ul>
```
`countHello(); // returns 2`


Bonus: Write a function that makes all the Hello tags have a different style (maybe they become green or bold or have a background color)

Bonus bonus: instead of using "style" in your JavaScript, add a class to the Hello tags and use CSS.
